Advent Of Code 2024 (Solutions, C++)

Problems: [text](https://adventofcode.com/2024)

## About

This depot contains my solutions to the 2024 puzzles, as written. I started late this year, Friday 13th, and didn't find time to do it every day. This code doest not include solutions for every problem. It does not earn 50-stars.

It is NOT an example of best practice, or ideal solutions.

This depot is just me, getting it done in C++ as quick as I could.

There has been is no follow-up refactoring, or tidy up, aside this last README edit.

The C++ used is C++17 and contains no 3rd party code or SDKs. 

It does contain copies of graph (A*) and Geometry/math code I'd written for other projects already on github.


If you have any questions, please feel free to get in touch.

## aoc-2023

I did not participate in Advent of Code in 2023.

## aoc-2022

I used Unreal Engine in 2022, using a mixture of Blueprint and C++. The code is not on github, but I blogged about it here:
